Descripion: 

The application imitates the behavior of the pokedex from the popular animated series Pokemon. The backend of the application was written in Spring Boot and the front end in Angular. In the links there is a live review of the application and a link to a server on the Heroku platform with which you can try out my application, which I strongly encourage you to do.
